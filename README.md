# Food-101
Framework used: Tensorflow
Python Libraries used: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Description: Used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and EfficientNetB7 model (using Transfer Learning) in Tensorflow to classify images of 101 different classes of food with 77% accuracy.
Used Mixed Precision traing to speed up the processing time.
Used Image Augmentation to reduce overfitting on the training dataset and improving the accuracy of the testing dataset.
