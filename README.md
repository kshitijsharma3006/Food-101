# Food-101
Framework used: Tensorflow |
Python Libraries used: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn. |
Description: Used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and EfficientNetB7 model (using Transfer Learning) in Tensorflow to classify images of 101 different classes of food with 77% accuracy. |
Used Mixed Precision traing to speed up the processing time. |
Used Image Augmentation to reduce overfitting on the training dataset and improving the accuracy of the testing dataset. |
